# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

* Dataset:
 -> Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

* Files:
+CodeBook.md -contains the information for all data transformation to clean and organize the data 
+run_analysis.R - contains the code for all steps described on the code book:
. Create a unique set of data by merging test and train data
. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
: Create a SecondTidyData.txt containing the extraction result
